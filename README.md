## Natural Language Processing From Scratch
This repository serves as a collection of projects focused on the theories, concepts, and implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and models from scratch. The primary goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how these powerful models work under the hood by building them without relying on high-level libraries by using pre-trained model.

## Project Areas Covered
Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a specific NLP topic. Within each project, you will find detailed explanations of the foundational theories and step-by-step code implementations from scratch.

- **Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis:** Building models that can categorize text into predefined classes or determine the emotional tone of a piece of writing.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Creating systems that can identify and extract key entities, such as names, locations, and organizations, from raw text.
- **Question Answering (QA):** Developing models that can retrieve information and answer questions based on a given text or document.
- **Information Retrieval and Search:** Implementing the core components of a search engine to find relevant documents based on a user's query.
- **Text Generation:** Building models that can generate new, coherent, and contextually relevant text.
- **Machine Translation:** Creating systems to automatically translate text from one language to another.
- **Text Summarization:** Developing algorithms to condense long documents into shorter, more concise summaries.
- **Paraphrase Detection and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS):** Building models that can identify when two different sentences have the same meaning.
- **Topic Modeling:** Creating models to discover the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.
- **Speech Recognition:** Exploring the concepts and implementing components for converting spoken language into text.

## Getting Started
To explore these projects, simply navigate to the topic folders. You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub or clone the repository to run them locally. Each notebook is designed to be a standalone guide to its respective topic with end-to-end of NLP pipeline.
